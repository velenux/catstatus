Cat Status is a simple Sinatra experiment. Purpose is quite
simple: to get a database crowded with data about your cat
status over a time span.

Maybe we'll have fancy charts, too!

As you can see, you need: sinatra, haml and erubis gems, so
grab your favourite shell and install them (as root/sudo):

# gem install sinatra haml erubis

Then you can start Cat Status:

$ ruby catstatus.rb
== Sinatra/0.9.5 has taken the stage on 4567 for development with backup from WEBrick
[2010-03-07 05:35:14] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
[2010-03-07 05:35:14] INFO  ruby 1.8.7 (2010-01-10) [i486-linux]
[2010-03-07 05:35:19] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=3820 port=4567

Then connect with your browser to:
http://127.0.0.1:4567

And enjoy!
